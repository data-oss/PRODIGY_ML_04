# Hand Gesture Recognition Model

## Overview
This project focuses on **Hand Gesture Recognition** using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The model detects and classifies different hand gestures, enabling applications such as touchless control systems, sign language recognition, and gesture-based user interfaces.

## Features
- **Real-time hand detection** using OpenCV and Mediapipe
- **Feature extraction** from hand landmarks
- **Machine learning classification** for gesture recognition
- **Model training and evaluation** using Scikit-learn or deep learning frameworks
- **Visualization of gesture predictions**

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-recognition.git
   cd hand-gesture-recognition
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset and train the model:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook handguster.ipynb
   ```
2. Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different model architectures.
3. Deploy the model for real-time hand gesture detection.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images or video frames labeled with different hand gestures. It includes:
- **Gesture types**: Thumbs up, OK sign, Victory sign, etc.
- **Landmark points** extracted from hand skeletons
- **Preprocessed features** for model training

## Model Training
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Extracting key hand landmarks and normalizing data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful representations from hand movements.
3. **Model Selection**: Training classifiers such as SVM, Random Forest, or Deep Learning models.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and real-time testing.

## Results
The model successfully recognizes different hand gestures with high accuracy, demonstrating its potential for applications in:
- Touchless user interfaces
- Smart home automation
- Assistive technologies for differently-abled individuals

## Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy using **deep learning architectures**
- Extend the dataset with more gestures and variations
- Deploy the model as a **real-time web or mobile application**
